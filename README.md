# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte library, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

Read more about creating a library [in the docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.

## Testing Your Package

To test a package, you can use npm link, which links a package globally, and lets you use it anywhere.

```bash
npm link
```

You can run the following command to see your linked packages:

```bash
npm ls --link --global
```

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```
